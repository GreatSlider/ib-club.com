The Japanese company BitFlyer received a license as a payment institution (PI) for the European Union on the basis of its official approval in the US and Japan. BitFlyer handles about a quarter of the world's bitcount exchange volume, with more than $ 250 billion in bitcoins that were sold on its platform last year. Yuzo Kano, founder and CEO of BitFlyer, said: "When I founded BitFlyer in 2014, I did it with global ambitions and the belief that the long-awaited regulatory status is crucial for the future of bitcoin and the virtual currency industry.

I am proud that now we are a virtual market that best meets all the requirements. The long-awaited regulatory status gives our clients, our company and the virtual currency industry a very positive outlook for the future. " BitFlyer is the only crypto-exchange, licensed in Europe, so it can provide traders with access to the world's largest bitcoin market located in Japan. It is estimated that about 10 billion euros in bitkoyne are traded every month around the world, which makes the euro the third largest market bitcoin after the Japanese yen and the US dollar. The exchange received its European license from the Luxembourg Commission for Supervision of the Financial Sector. In Europe, there are different positions on this issue: the German Bundesbank called for global regulation of bitcoins, while the French finance minister wants to establish stricter rules for crypto-currency.

The project is financed by the Ministry of Economy and Technology of the country. Beginning in March, the National Board of Tourism of Germany (GNTB) began accepting payments in crypto-currencies such as bitcoin as a payment for tourist services, using Blockchine technology to support cryptonyms in the German and international markets in accordance with the interests of the country. Funded mainly by the Ministry of Economics and Technology of Germany, GNTB serves to promote tourism in Germany, developing products and strategies to create a positive image of the country. The organization has thirty-two offices, representing it all over the world. The chairman of the National Council for Tourism of Germany Petra Hedorfer commented on this initiative: "In our strategy, we are constantly studying the latest technologies and considering the possibilities of their application in our organization. Defining the Crypto currency as a payment method and the possible implementation of Blockchain technology, we want to position ourselves as an innovative organization in the tourism industry. "

Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria is an amazing building, built in 1869, which became one of the icons of Renaissance architecture.

In Vienna, "Bitcoin-Bank", which provides the exchange of currency for bitcoins, was opened. It is reported that in Bitcoin-Bank, located on one of the most popular streets of the Austrian capital Mariahilfer Strasse, you can not only exchange the currency for bitcoins, but also get all the necessary information about crypto-currencies. Representatives of the Austrian crypto-exchange society reacted positively to this news. So, the local bitcoin enthusiast and head of the Bitcoin Austria Association Andreas Peterson said that he welcomed the introduction of bitcoin. "When I pay for something bitcoin, I get privacy and security. When I pay for digital goods, such as computer games, I understand that no one can receive my personal data, "Andreas says. Recall, the world's first bitcoin-automaton earned in Vienna in 2014.

ONE OF RUSSIAN HOTELS WILL TAKE CRYPTOMONETS DURING THE WORLD FOOTBALL WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 2018
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="text-align:justify">
This option has not yet spread to other hotels, but it is expected that other hotels will join this trend. The biggest football event in the world, the World Cup, will be held in just a few months. Fans from all over the world study the information on the Internet to book tickets and stay in Russia. Fortunately for users, Crypto-currency, Kaliningrad, one of the cities where the matches will be held, now accepts crypto-payments for the payment of hotel rooms. According to the information posted on the portal Buying Business Travel Russia, Malina Apartments teamed up with the online payment system Free-Kassa to allow users to pay for accommodation using crypto currency. In Kaliningrad, the matches will be played on June 16, 22, 25 and 28. The manager of apartments Malina Anna Subbotina has informed: "Crypto-currencies now use the raised interest. Gradually they will be used as a payment method. And we decided that fans should be able to pay for our services using this innovative technology.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="text-align:justify">
It is possible that other hotels will take advantage of our example. " Matches of the World Cup will be held in eleven Russian cities, including Ekaterinburg, Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don, Sochi, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Saransk and Kaliningrad. Apartments Malina are the only ones who made such a statement, therefore, Free-Kassa development director Vitaly Lavrov called it "an interesting experience": "We did not plan to cooperate with hotels in this format. But the hospitality industry is very sensitive to such trends. " However, the current cooperation of Free-Kassa with the Petersburg Social Commercial Bank (PSCB) shows that it is likely that St. Petersburg will also introduce crypto-currency payments. Recently, Russia was developing rules for crypto-vault and ICO in the new proposal "On Digital Financial Assets." However, the Economic Development Department, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Justice, the Central Bank of Russia and other authorities requested amendments with the aim of easing the rules for crypto-currency users. Although this decision was not approved by the Ministry of Finance, it was presented as a bill in which crypto-currencies are listed as "financial assets", and not as a method of legal payment.
